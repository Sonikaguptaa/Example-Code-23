This file is just an example for reference. You'll need to create an actual .env file

In your .env file, you'll setup your environment variable for your connection string to the database, which would look something like this:

MONGO_URL = mongodb+srv://USERNAME:PASSWORD@cluster0.kh5wqiw.mongodb.net/NAME_OF_DATABASE?retryWrites=true&w=majority

Note you'll need to put your USERNAME, PASSWORD, and the NAME_OF_DATABASE.

You can find this connection string on the MongoDB website by clicking Database (on the left in the navbar), then Connect, Drivers, and scroll to the bottom (it should be under Step 3).
